Project: Quantifying Resilience in the Amazon Rainforest
Authors: Theresa Wenzel, Tim Renner
Date:    February 10, 2026

1. GENERAL STATEMENT
--------------------
Theresa Wenzel and Tim Renner contributed equally to the research project. 
The workload was balanced, with tasks distributed according to individual 
strengths. The conceptualization, code review, and interpretation of results 
were conducted collaboratively.

2. DETAILED CONTRIBUTIONS
-------------------------

A) Conceptualization & Literature
   - T. Renner: Conducted the extended literature review and identified 
     the coupled vegetation-atmosphere model (Van Nes et al., 2014) as 
     the theoretical basis for the complex simulation.
   - T. Wenzel: Defined the project goals and developed the comparative 
     framework between Linear Stability and Basin Stability concepts.

B) Software Implementation & Data Visualization
   The Python codebase was developed in complementary modules. Both authors 
   were involved in implementing the ODE solvers and interpreting the 
   model dynamics.
   
   - T. Wenzel: 
     Responsible for the "Monte Carlo Basin Estimation" module. She implemented 
     the statistical sampling algorithm, the parallelization logic, and the 
     visualizations comparing Linear vs. Basin Stability.
     
   - T. Renner: 
     Responsible for the initial implementation of the described models,
     the high-resolution "Grid Scan" (Ground Truth) and 
     visualizing the system trajectories. He also performed the final code 
     refactoring and cleanup to ensure a structured project repository.
     
   - Joint Work: 
     Debugging the differential equations, fine-tuning the plotting parameters, 
     and the physical interpretation of the hysteresis effects.

C) Documentation & Presentation
   - T. Wenzel: Took the lead in designing the presentation storyline, 
     implementing the LaTeX slide deck, and writing the technical 
     documentation (README).
   - T. Renner: Contributed to the scientific phrasing of the results 
     and the final proofreading of the project deliverables.
